# Design a database for a flight-booking system

This project is a course project from the [Complete SQL Mastery course](https://members.codewithmosh.com/courses/enrolled/525068) by Code with Mosh.  
In this project, we design a database for an imaginary flight booking system, with a sample ticket provided.

## Description

We follow these steps of data modeling:

- Understand the business requirements
- Build a conceptual model
- Build a logical model
- Build a physical model

In this project, our purpose is to design a database to record necessary data for the flight booking system. 
The project description file "PROJECT-Flight-Booking-System.pdf" shows a sample ticket generated by the system.

### Files

- The conceptual model and logical model are generated by [draw.io](draw.io).
- The physical model is generated in MySQLWorkbench, and exported as pdf for readability.
